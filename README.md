Twitter Bot for OpenAI-generated Tweet Threads
This is a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to generate tweet threads and the Tweepy library to post them on Twitter. The bot can be run continuously and will post one tweet thread every 3 hours for each of the specified prompts.

Installation
To run the bot, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

OpenAI
Tweepy
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install openai tweepy
Usage
Before using the bot, you'll need to set up your OpenAI and Twitter API keys and access tokens. Replace the placeholders in the code with your own keys and tokens:

python
Copy code
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

consumer_key = 'YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)
You'll also need to define the tweet prompts you want the bot to use:

python
Copy code
prompts = [
    "What's new in Thailand's cannabis industry?",
    "How are NFTs changing the cannabis industry?",
    "Why is cannabis hospitality the next big thing?",
]
The tweet interval is set to 3 hours by default:

python
Copy code
tweet_interval = 3 * 60 * 60 # 3 hours
To run the bot, simply run the script:

Copy code
python tweet_bot.py
The bot will continuously check if it's a new day, and if so, it will generate and post one tweet thread for each prompt every 3 hours. If it's not a new day, the bot will sleep for 1 minute before checking again.
